# Solution of Ill-posed Problems with Chebfun

This repository contains MATLAB livescripts and files corresponding to the paper
“Solution of Ill-posed Problems with Chebfun” by Abdulaziz Alqahtani, Thomas
Mach, Lothar Reichel.

The code was tested with MATLAB R2020b and the latest release of Chebfun
(v.5.7.0). The Chebfun package is [available on github under https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun](https://github.com/chebfun/chebfu.n).

The examples are mostly modified version of [Regularization Tools Version 4.1](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~pcha/Regutools/).
One example is inspired by 

Gazzola, S., Hansen, P. C., & Nagy, J. G. (2019). IR Tools: a MATLAB package
of iterative regularization methods and large-scale test problems. Numerical
Algorithms, 81(3), 773-811.
