%
% 1-D model problem in gravity surveying, in which a mass distribution f(t) is
% located at depth d, while the vertical component of the gravity field g(s) is
% measured at the surface.  
%
% The resulting problem is a first-kind Fredholm integral equation with kernel
%    ke(s,t) = d*(d^2 + (s-t)^2)^(-3/2) .
% The following three examples are implemented (example = 1 is default):
%    example = 1: f(t) = sin(pi*t) + 0.5*sin(2*pi*t),
%    example = 2: f(t) = piecewise linear function,
%    example = 3: f(t) = piecewise constant function.
%
% Both integration interval are [0,1].
%
% The parameter d is the depth at which the magnetic deposit is located,
% and the default value is d = 0.25. The larger the d, the faster the
% decay of the singular values.
