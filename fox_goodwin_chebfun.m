% INPUT: NONE
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% ke ......... chebfun2
%                the function ke(s,t)
%
% f .......... chebfun 
%                the function f(t)
% 
% g .......... chebfun 
%                the function g(s)

%          1
%  g(s) =  âˆ«   ke(s,t) f(t) dt
%          0
%
% A first-kind Fredholm integral equation with kernel
%    ke(s,t) = sqrt(s^2 + t^2)
% and with integration intervals
% s \in [0,1],  t \in [0,1].
% The solution is given by
%    f(t) = t.
%
% The right-hand side is
%     g(s) = 1/3 ((1+s^2)^(3/2) - s^3)
%
% This is a model problem which does not satisfy the
% discrete Picard condition for the small singular values.
% The problem was first used by Fox & Goodwin.
