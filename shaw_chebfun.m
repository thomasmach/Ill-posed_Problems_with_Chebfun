% INPUT: NONE
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% ke ......... chebfun2
%                the function ke(s,t)
%
% f .......... chebfun 
%                the function f(t)
% 
% g .......... chebfun 
%                the function g(s)

%         \pi/2
%  g(s) =  âˆ«   ke(s,t) f(t) dt
%        -\pi/2
%
% A first-kind Fredholm integral equation with kernel
%    ke(s,t) = (cos(s)+cos(t))*(sin(u)/u)^2, with 
%          u = pi*(sin(s)+sin(t))
% and with integration intervals
% s \in [-pi/2,pi/2],  t \in [-pi/2,pi/2].
% The solution is given by
%    f(t) = a1*exp(-c1*(t - t1)^2) + a2*exp(-c2*(t - t2)^2), with
%      a1 = 2; c1 = 6; t1 =  .8;
%      a2 = 1; c2 = 2; t2 = -.5;
%
% The right-hand side is computed based on ke and f.
